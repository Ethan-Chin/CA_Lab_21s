Ex1:
Given the way the address was broken down, how big are the pages in this model?
	5 bit for offset, 32 byte per page
How many TLB Hits and Misses did we have for the randomly generated set of ten addresses? What about for Page Hits and Page Faults?
	Mine TLB is 5 hits and 5 misses, page hits=0, page faults=5
Did you have any Page Hits? Explain why. Can you think of a set of ten addresses that would result in a Page Hit?
	No. For the page that we have visted, if we want to visit it again, we just need to visit it in TLB instead of hitting it in Page Table.
	No. Since physical memory has 4 frames and TLB has 4 entries. 
	Once a page is loaded into physical memory, it also loaded into TLB. It's the same for evicting.
	So we can never find a page which is inside physical memory but outside TLB.
Explain the process by which we turn a virtual address into a physical address for the very first access (emphasizing on TLB Misses and Page Faults).
	decode->TLB(not inside)->page table(not inside physical memory)->page miss->load it from disk to physical memory frame

Ex2:
	见图, 2F,4F,6F,8F,AF,2F,4F,6F,8F,AF

Ex3:
	Change physical memory to 5 frames, 10 TLB misses, 5 Page misses
